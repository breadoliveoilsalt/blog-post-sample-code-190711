      <p>Thanks for visiting Birch, a tool to search for your next favorite book!</p>

      <p>On the search page, simply type in a search term, click "Search," and browse the results.  Click "Clear Search" to start again.</p>

      <p>Birch's search functionality is thanks to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developers.google.com/books/"> Google Books API</a>. Its name comes from imagining how to combine the the words "book" and "search."</p>

      <p>Enjoy!</p>
